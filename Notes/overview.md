# Overview

## Start Menu

Players pick between starting a new game, changing settings, and looking at past records/stats

Starting a new game opens the party creation screen

Up to six players can play

Players pick an existing character or make a new one

New characters require the player to enter their names, select a title and color

Titles are chosen by selecting one of three random options

Holding the back button exits back to main menu

## Gameplay

At game start an intro sequence is played

Uses the same text mechanics as the rest of the game

All players must hit the Submit button to skip a text page

When the intro finishes players pick between a set of preparation options

Players pick one at a time (on account of controller sharing)

Order is based on initiative or other extenuating circumstances

Any player who chooses the same option as another is considered as "following" that player

Each option has a predictable effect and a random event

The result of an event is effected by player stats and whether or not there are followers

Events play once all players have chosen their actions

Events play out as storyboards (with narration)

Only the effected player's need to press submit to skip

Storyboards advance on a timer regardless of input

## Menu

Pressing menu will pause the game at any point

Game menu has a settings option and a leave option

If all other players hit Back, the menu will close and the game will resume

## Events

Events may end with a player's death, after which they will haunt the rest of the players for the remainder of the game

Dead characters will not be selectable on future sessions but will be recorded

## Progression Flow

After preparations, the adventure begins as a series of days

Each day one group event occurs

In a group event some intro storyboard plays for all players, then all players choose their responses in order

Players who pick the same response collaborate (follow) on their actions

Once all players have picked their response, storyboards will show the results of each decision in order of the highest initiative in the group

Players will receive stat changes and effects/items based on the results of the event which are in turn based on their combined stats and effects going into the event

After which a conclusion storyboard plays

At the end of each day, players choose their camping activities which operate the same way as the preparation phase

## Finale

On the last day of the adventure, players encounter the Big Event which has three phases for decision making

After this, another final storyboard plays showing the endings for each player

Characters are saved to record
